This application is an Internet simulation via python. Routers and physics transfer medias are simulated by process.
Te rest of features are pretty close to real network protocols. However, I have to revise some protocol on link layer
so that I it can run on top of the simulated virtual systems.

This simulation run on top of python2.7


**library install**

    pip install menu: install text menu
    
    pip install netaddr : to manipulation ip and mac address

**Routers:**

    - Internet wire - process pipe and queue
    - Interface: type , name, Mac  and IP address
    - Source and destination (chat window)
    - Routing table
