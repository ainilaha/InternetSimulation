This application is an Internet simulation via python. Routers and physics transfer medias are simulated by process.
Te rest of features are pretty close to real network protocols. However, I have to revise some protocol on link layer
so that I it can run on top of the simulated virtual systems.

library install:
pip install menu: install text menu

pip install ipaddress : to manipulation ip address(you do need install it if you are using python 3.3+)  

Routers:
    - Internet wire - process pipe and queue
    - Interface: type , name, Mac  and IP address
    - Source and destination (chat window)
    - Routing table
